            How does the Trimmr URL Shortener Work?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            When you enter a long URL, our system generates a shorter version of
            that URL. This shortened URL redirects to the original long URL when
            accessed.

          <AccordionContent>
            Yes, Trimmr is completely free to use for shortening URLs. You can
            create as many shortened URLs as you need without any cost.
